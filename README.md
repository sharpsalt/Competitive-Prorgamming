#  Competitive Programming Repository

This repository is a curated collection of competitive programming solutions, templates, and utilities aimed at improving problem-solving speed and accuracy in coding contests. It includes both problem solutions and reusable algorithm templates written primarily in **C++** and **Python**.

---

##  Repository Structure

- `C++/`  
  Contains hand-written C++ solutions to various competitive programming problems.  
  Also includes:
  - `template.json` – A structured and searchable **template hub** covering a wide range of standard algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming.

- `README.md`  
  This file ✍

##  Algorithm Templates

One of the key features of this repository is the `template.json` file under the `C++/` directory. It serves as a **comprehensive snippet library** of reusable code segments for:

###  Key Algorithms Included:

- **Pragmas** (C++ Utils to Avoid TLE by Enabling specific optimizations when compiling with GCC or Clang.)
- **Fast IO** (in C++, for C++20 Specific , Copied from Research Paper)
- **Z-Algorithm** (pattern matching)
- **Segment Tree (Point Updates and Range Queries)**
- **Graph Algorithms**  
  - DFS, BFS  
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
  - Topological Sort  
  - Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- **Dynamic Programming Patterns**
- **Mathematical Utilities**
  - Modular Arithmetic  
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes  
  - GCD/LCM 
- **String Algorithms**
  - KMP  
  - Rolling Hash  
- And more (frequently updated!)

The JSON format allows for easy lookup, integration into custom IDE snippets, or even use in a browser-based tool for quick reference during contests.

##  Features

- Clean, categorized templates for fast access
- Competitive programming-ready code snippets
- Tested solutions and snippets used in real contests
- Continuously growing template library

---

## How to Use

1. Browse language-specific directories (`C++/`,`Python/`)
2. For algorithms or code snippets:
   - Open `C++/cp.json`
   - Search for the required algorithm by name or category
   - Copy and paste into your solution file during contests or practice

---

##  Notes

- `template.json` is manually maintained — more algorithms and data structures will be added over time.
- Naming may follow shorthand used during contests for speed.

---

##  Future Additions

- More templates (Lazy Segment Trees, Mo's Algorithm, Centroid Decomposition)
- Cleaner CLI/GUI for template lookup
- Cross-language template support (Java)
- Templates by tags or Folders

- Fix errors or optimize templates
- Add new commonly used snippets
- Suggest improvements to the JSON format
- Any Better Hack Test Generator(for both Python and C++23)
- Any Better Stress_Testing Algorithm
